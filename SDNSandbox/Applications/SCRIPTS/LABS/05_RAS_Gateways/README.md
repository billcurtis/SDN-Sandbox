# Lab 05 : RAS Gateways

## Objective

RAS Gateway is a software-based, multitenant, Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) capable router designed for Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) and Enterprises that host multiple tenant virtual networks using Hyper-V Network Virtualization. RAS Gateways routes network traffic between the physical network and VM network resources, regardless of the location. You can route the network traffic at the same physical location or many different locations.

In this series of exercises, you will learn to configure RAS Gateways in SDN.

The main types of Gateways we will look at are:

    1. L3 Gateways
    2. GRE Gateways
    3. IPSec Gateways

# Lab 5.01 L3 Gateways


# Lab 5.02 IPSEC Gateways


# Lab 5.03 GRE Gateways
