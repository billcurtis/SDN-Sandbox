Add a route to the routing table properties.

Any route not in the same VM subnet (192.172.33.25) gets routed to the Appliance VM at 192.172.33.25.
The appliance must have a virtual network adapter attached to the virtual network with that IP
assigned to a network interface.

Here we apply the routing table to the virtual subnet.

When you apply the route table to the virtual subnet, the first virtual subnet in the TenantNetwork1 network 
 uses the route table. You can assign the route table to as many of the subnets in the virtual network as you
 want.

    <#
 As soon as you apply the routing table to the virtual network, traffic gets forwarded to the virtual appliance.
  You must configure the routing table in the virtual appliance to forward the traffic, in a manner that is 
  appropriate for your environment.
